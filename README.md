# __Executive Summary:__
This project proposal outlines the development of a universal digital portal designed to automate
the food ordering process in the canteen. The primary objective is to introduce a user-friendly
digital platform that enables students to conveniently order and pay for their food, eliminating
the need for cash transactions and reducing waiting times through an efficient queue
management system. This report presents the project's objectives, features, and implementation
plan to address the current challenges faced by canteens in managing food orders and payments,
and the admin privileges which our system offers.

# __Introduction__
The canteen food ordering system plays a critical role in catering to the dietary needs of
students while fostering a streamlined and efficient process. However, the traditional
manual system often leads to long queues, cash handling issues, and increased waiting
times. This project proposes the development of a universal digital portal that
revolutionizes the canteen experience by automating the ordering process, introducing a
secure digital payment system, and implementing a queue management system.
Background and Product Context
The canteen at NSU faces challenges such as long queues, frustrated customers, limited seating,
and the unavailability of change, causing inconvenience and delays for students. To address these
issues, a digital solution is proposed to automate the food ordering process and improve the
overall customer experience.

# __Product Overview:__
The proposed solution is a web application designed to streamline food ordering in the canteen.
The application will display the available food items on both user and canteen screens, allowing
students to select their desired food and make online payments securely through a payment
gateway. Upon successful payment, users will receive a digital receipt with a unique queue
number. Canteen staff will serve the food based on the queue number, ensuring efficient order
delivery. The system will lock the queue number upon submission, preventing further
processing.
By implementing this digital portal, the canteen aims to eliminate long queues, minimize waiting
times, improve customer satisfaction, and facilitate cashless transactions, ultimately enhancing
the overall dining experience for students.
